## Description

Presume you want to create a text editor web application

The application needs to start in an editor to be able to see a client server folder structure
It must run with a command `npm run start` from the root directory
Once found that the application starts up the backend and serves the client
The text editor must be ran with the application from the terminal to be able to bundle the JavaScript files using webpack
Similarly, you must run the webpack plugins to be able to have generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
Furthermore, by using next-gen JavaScript in the application the text editor still functions in the browser without error
Now by opening the text editor you find that indexedDB has immediately created a database storage
Next you will be able to enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window to be able to see that the content in the text editor has been saved with indexedDB
Additionally, by clicking on the Install button the web application gets downloaded as an icon on your desktop
Once you load the web application you should have a registered service worker using workbox
Furthermore, by registering a service worker you should have the static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
While deploying it to Heroku you should have proper build scripts for a webpack application

## Mock-Up

The following gif shows the the web application's appearance and functionality:
